# Qriio Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Qriio app for Android!

This is an Android app for interactive education developed by Utkarsh for Qriio. The app is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that this app only collects the following information:

  1. email address - Your email address is collected to enable you to authenticate yourself and start using the content of the app.

The list of permissions required by the app as mentioned in the AndroidManifest.xml file are:

  1. android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"> - The app requires internet to be able to share the content with you. Hence we are asking for this permission.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
